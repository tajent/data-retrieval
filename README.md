As part of my learning Java, I was curious as to how to incorporate databases into it, as this is bound to come up at some point.
So downloaded a sample database (Chinook) from https://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com and set about completing a set of tasks.

The tasks to complete are as follows:

   Using only JDBC (no third party libraries) and JUnit, use TDD to write some Java code to connect to a Postgres database and find the 
   name of the customer that has:
 - the most invoices
 - highest value total invoices
 - highest single value invoice
 
   Present the results on the console and in a web page
 
 Not all task have been completed, but this is my progress so far.
